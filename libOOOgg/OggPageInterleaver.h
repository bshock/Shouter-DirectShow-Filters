/** @class OggPageInterleaver

    @brief Use OggPageInterleaver to interleave two or more Ogg logical
	       bitstreams into one physical bitstream.

    To feed data into OggPageInterleaver, you will need to create one
	OggMuxStream for every logical bitstream that you wish to interleave.  Use the
	newStream() method to do this (don't create your own OggMuxStreams, otherwise
	OggPageInterleaver won't know anything about them, which is Bad).  Feed your
	pages to each OggMuxStream using its OggMuxStream::acceptOggPage() method.
	(If you have your data in packets instead of pages, you'll need to use
	OggPaginator to put them into pages first: see its documentation for details).
	Note that you'll probably need to set the conversion parameters in
	OggMuxStream using OggMuxStream::setConversionParams() to get proper Ogg
	pages.  Again, see its documentation for details.
